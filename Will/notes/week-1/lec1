Everything in Python is an object!
^very malleable, but has some drawbacks
^especially useful when writing functions, since you can call the same methods/operators on diff types

Assignment
- can have more than 1 thing to the left of the equals sign.
- relies on language-specific stuff though (generally speaking, but it's extremely common)
- i.e. a, b = generate_tuple() #<- this function returns some sort of 2-element object, such as (1, 2) or [1, 2]
